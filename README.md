## Setup
To set up and run the project, from the parent folder, run `npm i` on the terminal.
You can run `npm run concurrent` to run both the client and server together in development mode.

### About This Project
This project began from create-react-app and was then transformed into a full stack with a client react folder as well as a folder for a basic express.js server.

It was then merged into next.js for SEO server-side-rendering.

This is the next.js full stack version.
